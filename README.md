# emailApp
This is an email app to help me learn Java.

## Run
Clone this repository and open the folder. Add a new email by using `new Email()`.
The application will set some default values e.g. `password` & `alternateEmail`.
Call `getInfo()` in a print method to see the values that have been set.
